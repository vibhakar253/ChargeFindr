# ChargeFindr

ChargeFindr is a web application developed using the MERN stack. It enables users to register and
login to find electric vehicle (EV) charging stations near their location using Google Maps. Users
can get directions to these stations and book slots for charging their vehicles. The app also features
an admin module where a designated admin can register and login to add new charging stations,
manage available slots for charging, and edit existing time slots as needed.
